- 🗝️ If you would like to join the beta, follow the steps on this guide: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Joining the Beta](https://github.com/LegendsUnchained/vpx-standalone-alp4k/wiki/%5B01%5D-%F0%9F%92%9A-Joining-the-Beta)

<br>

## _The Rules!_

- 📖 ***READ ALL INSTRUCTIONS... TWICE!*** <br>
  Make sure to take the time to fully ready through the wiki and other support threads too. <br> <br>

- 🚫 ***DO NOT SHARE FILES!*** <br>
  **DO NOT** share any `VPXS Launcher` files, `Table Manager` files, `.vpx` files, `.directb2s` files, `.c7z` serum files, `puppack` files, or `ROM` files with anyone. <br>
  Doing so will trigger the DRM and ban your account along with anyone you share files with.  <br>
  Download files from official sources. The README links and the Wizard download button links will point to official sources. <br>
  **DO NOT** share invite codes, if you do the entire invite chain gets banned.  <br>
  Seriously, <u>**DON'T DO IT**</u>. There are no warnings, no second chances... once banned, it cannot be reversed. <br> <br>

- 🩷 ***BE RESPECTFUL!***  <br>
  Everyone here is doing this in their spare time and aren’t getting paid so be nice to one another. <br>
  Please be respectful if you get a message from the mods that you didn't expect. There is always a reason, make sure to listen. <br> <br>

- 🕰️ ***BE PATIENT!***  <br>
  Participate as often as possible. This is the only way to get Beta access. <br>
  **DO NOT** ask for a Beta Invite and / or ask when VPXS GL will be released!! <br>
  Listen to the advice given to you, retry installs if something goes wrong, don't rush through setup. <br>
  Your problems are not everyone else's problems. People are here to help, but helping you is not everyone's priority. <br> <br>

- 💬 ***DO NOT DM OR @mention PEOPLE!*** <br>
  **DO NOT** DM people directly asking for help unless you are asked to do so. <br>
  If you are stuck, read through the Wiki one more time, and then ask for help in `#general-vpx-chat` or `💬 vpx-beta-support`. <br>
  If you are a Beta tester using the `💬 vpx-beta-support` channel, the please be sure to read the "How To Get Support" post before submitting. <br>
  It may take a while to get a response, so please remember to be patient. <br> <br>

- 🎉 ***HAVE FUN!*** <br>
  The fun is _mandatory_! 😁 <br>
  Once in the Beta, participate in the optional weekly tournaments, share your successes, and enjoy! <br> <br>

 <br>

> ***⚠️ Breaking the rules may result in a ban from the beta.*** <br>
> You may not receive another warning. Bans cannot be challenged.

<br>

> ***⚠️ Being banned from the Mox Discord Server will also result in a Beta ban*** <br>
> Do not break any of Discords T&C's. Follow the Mox Discord server rules found in the `🪧 Server Guide`
