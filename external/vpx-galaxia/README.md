## Instructions

- Copy the contents of this repo folder to your USB drive
- Add your personalized launcher.elf and rename it to `vpx-galaxia.elf`
- Download the table and directb2s versions listed above, extract (if necessary) and copy them into `vpx-galaxia`
- Make sure `(.vpx)` `(.directb2s)` `(.vbs)` and `(.ini)` are all named the same. Do not rename VPinballX.ini

## NOTES
1. Yes, I realize that there SHOULD BE an accent over the second 'a'. I am working on a Mac, and frequently encounter discrepancies between the way Windows and MacOS handle ASCII. Please understand that any omissions other than the ones in the filenames are unintentional.

2. This table has a graphic bug in displaying scores. To overcome it, the .vbs adds and subtracts one point at the start of every ball. No, it's not a very elegant solution, but it doesn't slow down gameplay
