## Optional

The puppack and alternate sounds are optional, but enhance the table quite a lot.

- Download the lotr_1.0.1.zip puppack from the above link.
- Create the folder pupvideos/lotr and extract the lotr_1.0.1.zip in this folder.
- Unzip the use_these_pup_files.zip and place them inside the pupvideos/lotr folder, and overwrite files if prompted. __This is necessary otherwise the table crashes after a while and your playfield will blink.__
- __Delete the directb2s file because this is not needed anymore and makes the backglass blink.__
- Download the altsound_lotr_Sjoend_normalized.zip package from the above link.
- Create the folder pinmame/altsound/lotr folder and extract the files from the zip in the folder LOTR_Sjoend_normalized into this folder.
