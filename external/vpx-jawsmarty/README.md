| File Type | Link | Version | Author |

| **VPX** | [VPUniverse](https://vpuniverse.com/files/file/25943-jaws_50th_anniversary/?changelog=0) | 3.0 | [marty02](https://vpuniverse.com/profile/16531-marty02/) |

Please use version 3.0 of the table, NOT the newest 3.2. On the download page:
- Scroll down to "What's New in Version 3.2"
- Click on `See changelog,` and when the menu expands, click on the radio button for `3.0`, dated July 2, 2025
- Next to the text where "With version 3.0" appears, click `Download`
- Both B2S and mini-Pup come in the download with VPX
- To use with B2S, use the included B2S file, and DO NOT use the `.vbs`
- To use with mini-Pup (performance hit is negligible), create a `pupvideos` folder in the same folder with your `.vpx` file, and move the contents of `Backglass_PUP/JAWS_50Th_Anniversary/` into the new pupvideos folder. DO NOT use the `.vbs` file found here.
