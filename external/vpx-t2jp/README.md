## Instructions

- Copy the contents of this repo folder to your USB drive
- Add your personalized launcher.elf and rename it to `vpx-t2jp.elf`
- Download the table and directb2s versions listed above, extract (if necessary) and copy them into `vpx-t2jp`
- Rom file `t2_l8.zip` stays in zip folder, place zip file in `vpx-t2jp/pinmame/roms`
- Make sure `(.vpx)` `(.direct2b2s)` `(.vbs)` and `(.ini)` are all named the same.

## Optional

The puppack is optional, install if you like videos on your backglass.

- Download the `t2_l8.zip` puppack from the link listed above.
- Create the folder `pupvideos` and extract the `t2_l8.zip` in this folder. Filename is the same as the rom filename, so check that you extract the correct file and not the rom.
- Unzip the `use_these_pup_files.zip` and place them inside the `pupvideos/t2_l8` folder, and overwrite files if prompted.
- __Delete the directb2s file because this is not needed anymore and makes the backglass blink.__
